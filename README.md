# snakegrid 🐍

A tiny, dependency-free **layout daemon for [Hyprland](https://hypr.land)** that turns
two desktops into a flowing **2×2 "snake" grid**. New windows enter the top-left and
everything else *slides* one slot along the snake — and when the first desktop fills up,
the oldest window glides onto the next one.

> Pure `python3` standard library. It talks **straight to Hyprland's IPC sockets** — no
> `hyprctl` forking at runtime, no plugins to compile, no extra dependencies.

## Demo

<!-- Record one with `./scripts/record-demo.sh` (needs wf-recorder + gifski/ffmpeg),
     drop the result in docs/demo.gif, then uncomment the line below: -->
<!-- ![snakegrid in action](docs/demo.gif) -->

## What it does

- The **newest window** always takes **Desktop A's top-left**; every existing window
  slides one step along the snake path: **TL → TR → BR → BL**.
- When Desktop A's four tiles are full, the **oldest window overflows to Desktop B** and
  the snake continues there — **8 tiles across two desktops**.
- A **9th** window just opens normally (the grid is capped at 8).
- **Every other desktop is left as normal Hyprland tiling.**
- **Multi-monitor aware** — each grid desktop is laid out on its own monitor, with correct
  offsets and HiDPI scaling (it reads your live geometry from Hyprland, nothing is hardcoded).
- The sliding is Hyprland's own `windowsMove` animation, so it looks smooth for free.
- **The grid size is configurable** — `SNAKE_GRID=3x3` gives a nine-tile snake per desktop
  (see [Configure](#configure)).

## Plays nice with your workflow

snakegrid tries hard *not* to fight you:

- **Dialogs & popups are left alone.** Anything that opens *floating* (file pickers, settings
  popups, permission prompts) is ignored instead of being yanked into a tile — so opening one
  no longer shoves your whole grid around. You can also name classes to always skip with
  `SNAKE_IGNORE` (see below).
- **Drag windows in and out.** Move a managed window to another desktop and snakegrid
  **releases** it (it won't drag it back). Move any window *onto* a grid desktop and snakegrid
  **adopts** it into the next free tile.
- **Fullscreen is respected.** A fullscreened grid window is never resized or moved; it snaps
  back into its tile when you leave fullscreen.
- **Clean teardown.** `snakegrid` (toggle off) re-tiles **only the windows snakegrid managed**,
  not every floating window you happened to have open.

## Fast by design

- **Direct socket IPC** — queries (`j/clients`, `j/monitors`) and dispatches (`[[BATCH]]…`)
  go straight to Hyprland's command socket instead of spawning the `hyprctl` binary, which
  is ~**25× faster per call** (≈0.5 ms vs ≈12.5 ms). A relayout is sub-millisecond.
- **Drift-skip** — each pass only sends the dispatches that actually change something
  (position/size/float-state/desktop, within a small pixel tolerance). A window already in
  place costs **zero** commands, so nothing re-jiggles and there's no wasted work.
- **Cached geometry** — monitor/workspace info is read once and reused, refreshed only when
  monitors or workspaces actually change.
- **Self-healing** — if Hyprland's event socket ever drops, the daemon reconnects with
  backoff instead of silently dying, and a **single-instance lock** stops two daemons from
  fighting over the layout.

> If a window *creation* ever feels slow, that's the **application** spawning its window —
> snakegrid places it in well under a millisecond *after* it appears (see Debugging).

## Requirements

- Hyprland
- `python3` (standard library only)

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/heian-sukuna/Snakegrid.git
cd Snakegrid
./install.sh
```

This copies the daemon + the `snakegrid` command into `~/.config/hypr/scripts`, links
`snakegrid` into `~/.local/bin`, and adds a *gated* autostart line to your Hyprland config
(it only runs at login if you ask it to — see below).

To remove everything the installer added:

```sh
./install.sh --uninstall
```

### Arch (AUR)

A `PKGBUILD` is included for the `snakegrid-git` package:

```sh
makepkg -si
```

## Usage — just four commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `snakegrid` | toggle the grid **on/off for this session** |
| `snakegrid --always-on` | start it **automatically at every login** |
| `snakegrid --always-off` | stop auto-starting it at login (and turn it off now) |
| `snakegrid --help` | show help |

## Configure

Everything is set through **environment variables** — no need to edit the installed script
(which `./install.sh` overwrites on every update anyway):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SNAKE_WS` | `1,2` | the grid desktops, in overflow order (e.g. `SNAKE_WS=4,5`) |
| `SNAKE_GRID` | `2x2` | tiles per desktop as `ROWSxCOLS` (e.g. `3x3`, `2x3`) |
| `SNAKE_GAP` | `10` | pixels between tiles and screen edges |
| `SNAKE_TOL` | `2` | px slack before a window is considered "out of place" |
| `SNAKE_IGNORE` | *(empty)* | comma-separated window **classes** to never manage, e.g. `SNAKE_IGNORE=pavucontrol,org.gnome.Calculator` |
| `SNAKE_DEBUG` | *(off)* | set to `1` to trace timings to `/tmp/snakegrid.log` |

> **Setting them for autostart:** the login autostart line runs under Hyprland's environment,
> so export your overrides where Hyprland picks them up (e.g. `env = SNAKE_GRID,3x3` in
> `hyprland.conf`, or your `~/.config/hypr/*.conf`).

**Tip:** for a snappier feel, give Hyprland a quick, no-overshoot move animation in your
config, e.g. `animation = windowsMove, 1, 2, snappy` (200 ms). snakegrid's placement is
instant; this just controls how the slide *looks*.

**Tip — instant opens:** a window opens *tiled* for an instant before snakegrid floats it
into its tile. snakegrid places it in well under a millisecond, so the only thing you actually
perceive is Hyprland's *animation* of that first move — keep the `windowsMove` animation snappy
(as above) and it reads as instant. This is the whole trick; there's nothing else to configure.

> **Coexisting with your own float rules.** snakegrid treats a *floating* window on a grid
> desktop as a dialog and leaves it alone — that's how it avoids yanking file pickers into the
> grid. If you deliberately float some app on a grid workspace and *do* want it tiled into the
> snake, add a `tag +snakegrid` window rule for it; snakegrid always manages tagged windows.
> (Don't hardcode `size`/`move` rules for grid windows — snakegrid computes those from your
> live monitor geometry, so fixed values just fight the daemon.)

## How it works

The daemon connects to Hyprland's **event socket** (`.socket2.sock`) and reacts to window
**open/close/move/fullscreen** (and monitor/workspace changes). For each event it computes the
target grid from your live monitor geometry, then repositions the managed windows over the
**command socket** (`.socket.sock`) in a single batched request — floating each window and
snapping it to its slot with `movewindowpixel` / `resizewindowpixel`. Because those moves go
through Hyprland's normal animation pipeline, the tiles **slide** into place.

Some apps (browsers like Zen/Firefox) restore their own remembered window size a moment
*after* they map. To handle that, snakegrid re-applies the layout a few times over the first
second after a window opens — and thanks to drift-skip, those passes send nothing once the
window has settled.

## Debugging

Run the daemon with `SNAKE_DEBUG=1` to trace timings to `/tmp/snakegrid.log`:

```sh
SNAKE_DEBUG=1 python3 ~/.config/hypr/scripts/snake-grid.py
```

You'll see a `daemon start` line (pid + config), per-relayout duration + dispatch count,
`openwindow … → placing` markers with the **per-open timing** (`[query …ms, total …ms]` — the
time from the open event to the window being placed) or `left alone`, adopt/release lines, and
any errors that would otherwise be swallowed — handy for confirming where any latency really
lives. Placement is typically a few milliseconds; settled windows show `0 dispatches`. It's
off (and free) by default.

## Development

The geometry and config helpers are pure functions with unit tests:

```sh
pip install pytest ruff
pytest -q          # tests
ruff check .       # lint
```

CI ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs `ruff`, `pytest`, and
`shellcheck` on every push.
